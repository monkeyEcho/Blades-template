Rumors about getting new supplies from the Capital City, including better weapons & some kind of other 'support'. What is certain is that - thanks to good pay for the officers - they work mainly for 'economic interests', at least as long as the money's right."

They like to attack under the cover of nightly darkness, often supported by thunderstorm and spirits of nature. Gray eminence behind Chief Good Hunter is the shaman The Old One.

They were offered no mercy on their path and therefore they tend to show none either. Rumors about mysterious ways like sticking needles into bodies and other blood magic were heard.

Many of them are revealed, traded, whitewashed and 'forgotten' in Polly’s house, for a reasonable 'fee' of course. Lately, she prevented a hostile and bloddy takeover attempt executed by the Wong family. After some struggle both sides agreed on a peaceful cooperation ... for now."

A notorious drunk he first doesn’t seem to care but lately his sermons tend to focus on false prophets and religious zealots on their way to Hell. Especially those calling themselves 'Michael'.

Edwina is convinced that her husband will be back, not only soon but also alive. That may explain why she’s always in company of a coffin in which the mortal remains of Rufus should rest. Primary mean of the gang to earn money are robberies, but recently also individual acquisitions of strange materials. The latter seem to be for personal use."
