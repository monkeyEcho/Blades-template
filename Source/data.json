Currently a fierce competition with the Express results into several carriages ambushed, missing or lost. People say that the Thunder Raven Tribe is responsible for those incidents with the Pony Express as beneficiary."

Public goal is the advancement of the common good: Hardly any event in the city without approval of Good Health. Only the inner circle (calling itself the „Knights of Solomon“) knows the real goal, but no one’s talking and membership of the inner circle is highly exclusive. Some rumors about secret places and rituals in the wild, purpose unknown. Investing into new, weird and unconventional research."

			"tier": "II",
			"hold": "S",
			"notes": "“The Express” is licensed for deliveries into the native territory and Mudwater. Lately under much pressure from competitor Fells & Wargo, because a single rider can only transport a small amount of Hellstone at a time. They are usually much faster, if the rider don’t vanish or dies from mutation or other cause."

Despite their short presence they already built some real clout due to their very aggressive methods. Rumors about them being a gang with 'unholy obligation & payback in hell' are surely exaggerated."

Only the Head Inquisitor “Michael” is known by face and name, all other Inquisitors are always hooded. Is there a terrible secret hidden beneath those hoods? Relationships to town officials, local church and nearly everybody else in Mudwater are tense. Michael may pay bounties for killed demons as long as you can prove the kill somehow."

Rumors have it that he had to leave England with his butler Alfred in a hurry after he hammered a stake into the heart of an alleged vampire / fellow English man. Splendid. May be wealthy, but this is hard to say. Had a run-in recently with the Good Health Association about that Shakespeare performance in the House of Roses."

A notorious drunk he first doesn’t seem to care but lately his sermons tend to focus on false prophets and religious zealots on their way to hell. Especially those calling themselves “Michael”. You got to love his energy!"

She does not only trade in sinful pleasures of the flesh but has a solid side business of dealing in secrets. Many of them are revealed, traded, whitewashed and 'forgotten' in Polly’s house, for a reasonable 'fee' of course. Lately, she prevented a hostile takeover attempt executed by the Wong Family. After some struggle both sides agreed on a peaceful cooperation... for now."

Edwina is convinced that her husband will be back, not only soon but also alive. That may explain why she’s always in company of a coffin in which the mortal remains of Rufus should rest. Primary mean of the gang to earn money are robberies."

Head of the family is Wong Cheng, age > 80, who came with his three sons (Fan, Hai and Huang) and their wives into the country. Rumors about mysterious ways like sticking needles into bodies and other blood magic were heard."
		}, {

			"tier": "I",
			"hold": "S",
			"notes": "Outlaw posse with hideout somewhere in the Shadow Valley. Rumored to be headed by a group of sisters of unknown origin. The posse is a tight-knit gang committed to absolute secrecy. The fact that a caught member who tried to brag died from spontaneous combustion strengthened the rumor that the gang is also a dark cult. Searching for artefacts lately."

		}, {
			"name": "faction_miners_union",
			"tier": "I",
			"hold": "W",
			"notes": "Some desperate souls trying to give the hard working and risk taking men and women in the mines what they deserve. Maybe desperate enough to take some unconventional actions. Headed by Gus Cochran, trying to make up his mind about his Lordship. Waiting for support from the Capital City."
